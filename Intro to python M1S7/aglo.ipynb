    "Listening to music can be very pleasant, but when a piece is really very repetitive, it sometimes happens that you get a little bored. So the musical composition teacher at the conservatory has decided to impose a very strict rule: when he rereads the pieces composed by his students, as soon as he sees two identical notes side by side, he erases them both! It thus continues to erase as long as there are two consecutive equal notes.\n",
